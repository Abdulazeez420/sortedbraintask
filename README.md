# Flutter Deep Linking, Routing, and FCM

## Introduction
This Flutter app demonstrates the use of deep linking, routing, and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

## Features
- Deep linking to specific screens using URL parameters
- Routing between Home, Detail, and Settings screens using GetX
- Receiving and handling FCM notifications

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Set up Firebase for your project and download the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) files.
4. Add the Firebase configuration files to your project.
5. Run `flutter run` to start the app.

## Testing Deep Linking
- Use a custom URL scheme or dynamic links to open the app to the detail screen.

## Testing FCM
- Use the Firebase console to send a notification to the app.
- Check if the notification is handled correctly in both foreground and background states.
